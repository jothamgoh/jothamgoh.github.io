I recently visited my girlfriend and her parent at their small hometown in Malaysia. <br />

One of their relatives (pictured above) runs this street stall which sells paper thin pancakes. <br />

This girl boss uses six mini woks on a bicycle. The woks are fuelled by a gas tank. Rain or shine, this old lady stands by the street for hours every day to cook these pancakes. <br />

She is constantly juggling the six pans. Switching her attention between the half and fully cooked pancakes.<br />

After removing a cooked pancake from its pan, she rolls it into half. She then wipes each pan with oil, puts the batter on and then puts on the pan lid for the heat to permeate. <br />

When we were there, there were three people in front of us and we had to wait about 15 minutes before we got our pancakes. Each customer orders at least 10 or 20 of these pancakes. Each pancake cost about 10 US cents.<br />

Her focus is efficiency and not hygiene. She handles the money and the pancakes simultaneously, and puts the notes and coins on the same spot where the pancakes sit. Locals still buy these pancakes anyway. They're thin, crispy, slightly sweet, and yummy.<br />
