title: 'Chapter 1: Who is a data analyst, why read this?'
---

This book is about my experience becoming a data analyst. I'm not in any definition an expert. I've worked at exactly two different companies as a data analyst, with a slew of data interviews (mostly successful, some not) under my belt. This is just one path you can take if you're looking to transition into a data analyst career. Call me biased but I think it's one of the most meaningful, impactful and future proof jobs out there right now.<br />

I have distilled of some of the things I've done right and the many things that I wish I had done better. To make it applicable, I've made the lessons into generalized principles while giving specific examples. The principles and lessons I learnt are all blatantly stolen in some form or other from the giants on whose shoulders I stand on - thinkers, writers and doers who've been around the block several times over. I'll link the resources that I have greatly benefitted from where possible.<br />
