This is my edit. <br />

<br />

Today, google photos sent me a reel from 5 years ago, where I went for a solo Bali trip prior to starting a new job. The Bali trip was a spur of the moment decision. I booked the trip on the day I received a new job offer, 2 days before flying to Bali. <br />

Sunrise trek on Mount Batur in Bali<br />

<br />

I was on a different life path back then. Two years out of university, I had already quit two finance jobs, took a 6 month sabbatical, and was going on to start a new tech job in a few days. <br />

Finance was the thing I loved studying in university, and I imagined doing it for my entire life. I remembered euphoric when learning finance concepts, and looking interviewers in the eye telling them that this finance job is what I’ll dedicate my life to. The reality of working in finance shook my beliefs, and I was done with finance a year and a half later. I then took the 6 months sabbatical to learn to code.<br />

<br />

When I was in Bali, my new end goal was to thrive in a tech career. I vividly recall the high I felt when my prospective boss called to offer me the job. I finally did it!!! Tech is THE thing I want. The tech job that I was starting was a junior position and I was determined to prove my value and climb the career ladder. And that’s what I did, getting two promotions in less than two years.<br />

But after working in that tech job for about two years, I was frustrated with the hyper-growth culture at that company and wanted a change. <br />

<br />

I think you know where I’m going with this now. <br />

<br />

Since then, I’ve had a new goal to work in a sustainable company with a good culture. I accomplished that, and my latest end goal is to start my own thing and quit working for a company altogether. <br />

<br />

Every time I have a big goal, I think to myself - now that’s the thing that will complete me. I imagine that once I achieve the goal, I’ll be set. That’s when I finally become happy. My current frustrations must depart once I achieve that goal. Nothing will be missing from my life when I achieve the goal. <br />

Five years and a few major goals later, my life has objectively changed. For good. I’m working with awesome colleagues, earning more money, working less hours, and I have freedom at my job that I did not envision was possible. The life I dreamed of a few years back is what I have now. I’m content more of the time, but I still experience many periods where I get angry, frustrated, lonely, sad. <br />

<br />

The thing is, I still want more.<br />

<br />

Achieving your goals won’t make you happy. It’s now obvious and trite to say this. But we, humans, are such efficient desiring machines that we can’t help but to pursue our goals. That’s great for advancing humanity and our own situations, but we know that it’s not the be all and end all. Often, the mountain top is so insignificant that we don’t even realise we’ve reached it.<br />

<br />

Since we can’t erase desire, let’s grade our goals into different categories. If we assume the holy grail is to be free of problems, here’s how I’ll grade different goals. <br />

<br />

In the F tier, achieve wealth, fame, status and disregard all else. <br />

In the C tier, <br />

A tier - goal to enjoy what you do as well as make yourself and other people better<br />

S tier - pursue our innate curiousity. Not even a goal anymore. It’s not like we’re pursuing curiousity with the end goal of becoming happy. We’re just doing it for it’s own sake. <br />
