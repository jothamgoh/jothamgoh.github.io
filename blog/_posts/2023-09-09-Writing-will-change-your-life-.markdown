title: Writing will change your life 3
---

You can’t walk in a thunderstorm and not get wet. In the same way, you can’t be a consistent writer and not be successful.<br />

We have a purpose for every action. For example, I <i>try to eat whole vegetables</i> as it makes me feel better. Even though I might not always like the immediate taste of veggies. But I know I’ll feel better throughout the day if my lunch was healthy. <br />

Eating that bag of chips gives me instant pleasure, but I know it’s bad for me in the long term. Even in the short term, I feel bad when I eat unhealthy food. <br />

A writing habit is like eating healthy. It takes effort, but it’s worth it. <br />

### <b>Writing results in clear thinking</b>
You can’t put ideas on a page without first knowing exactly what to say. Writing is a forcing function to clarify your thoughts. <br />

My mind is lazy when I don’t have to write. It restlessly drifts from one thought to another. Before I know it, I’m doing a multi-hour youtube binge. <br />

In contrast, I’m most resourceful when I’m writing an essay. Even when I’m away from my computer, I’m constantly imagining the flaws in my essay and thinking of ways to solve them. In my mind, I might rephrase the sentence I just wrote multiple times. Or I might recall a concept that I’ve came across years before that I can use for my essay. When the dots connect, I feel a lightbulb go off. That feeling never gets old.<br />

Writing forces me to explore the same topic through many different lenses. It’s like shining light on a diamond, where reflections on the many different facets makes it interesting. <br />

It turns out that writing is identical to worry. Both actions boil down to turning the same topic over and over multiple times in your mind. Except that the act of writing is productive worry. Writing forces clarity of thought which then gives you a solution to your problem. It lights the path in front of you. Traditional worrying instead only focuses on the what-ifs. It is unproductive, and the uncertainty of traditional worry is what perpetuates the negative spiral.<br />

### Writing builds curiosity
- It turns out that asking questions about a topic leads to more questions. It’s a cycle<br />

- Asking the right questions often lead to the solution. It’s more important to get the question right, than to find the solution out. Give an example<br />

### Writing builds good habits
- We don’t simply get rid of bad habits. We replace bad habits with good ones<br />

- Writing takes time. But it’s a productive use of time<br />

### Writing cultivates a spirit of excellence
- This is a way of the craftsman. It’s a skill, when learnt, can be applied to other domains<br />

- It’s about spotting the flaws and correcting them. It turns out that excellence and beauty is just spotting the flaws and correcting them. We don’t just do something excellent. Rather, we correct the flaws until we feel that something is excellent<br />

- Writing forces you to be nuanced. There is always a choice to use this word or that word. To phrase a sentence this way of that work. And it turns out that noticing the details is what separates the great from the good. This translates to other skills too.<br />

### Writing is pull marketing
- It turns out communicating your thoughts draws people to you like how moths are drawn to a flame. And words is one of the best ways to communicate complicated ideas<br />

- Prolific writers are the best thinkers. I suspect the act of writing makes them an expert, and not the other way around. <br />

- The body of work will last a lifetime. What you’re doing now will be referenced 10 years later. Even if you don’t have a big audience, sending your body of work to a prospective employer will change how you’re perceived. It shows people that you can think deeply, and it might just land you multiple job opportunities.<br />
