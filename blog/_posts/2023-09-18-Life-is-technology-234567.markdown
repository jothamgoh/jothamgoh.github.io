title: Life is technology 2345675
---

If your life was a startup, would it be a unicorn or go bankrupt? Editing this to see if it publishes a new post.<br />

<br />

Tech isn't just software. It is anything that makes our life better, but doesn't quite work just yet. 
<br />

At some point, the wheel and fire was the biggest breakthrough in tech. Harnessing both gave us the industrial revolution.<br />

<br />

Through this lens, we can see our life as technology too.<br />

Living a low tech life means sticking to the status quo. Like an old person hobbling from their bed to the toilet, only being familiar with their small comfortable world. <br />

<br />

The alternative is to treat our habits, desires, and beliefs like a startup. <br />

Instead of wasting our best years in an unhappy place, we could traverse life like an elite sprinter covering ground. Isn't that just a page out of technologyâ€™s playbook - to move fast and break things? We pivot fast if we're not content with life. <br />

<br />

Maybe something is better on the other side of uncertainty. The worst thing we can do is to be so sure we're already living our best life. And that our beliefs are already 100% right. <br />

<br />

Many beliefs that I held strongly 5 years ago, I now think are wrong. Oh how much more I've learnt about myself in the last few years. <br />

<br />

This pattern has played out too many times now, that I'm sure I'll laugh at myself again in another 5 years. <br />

<br />

But I take laughing at my past self as a litmus test that measures how high tech my beliefs are. The more I laugh, the better the result. <br />

<br />

And that's the high tech outlook on life. <br />
